# ucurrent
FreeCAD and STL files for enclosure for EEVblog ucurrent project[1],  based on files for uCurrent rev 5. 

Due to gerber import issues, I had to fix a few small things that didn't want to come out well - mostly silk screen/text problems, then I had a few boards manufactured.  It does what it promises on the box.

Thank you, Dave Jones!


## Assembly
I printed in Nylon SLS, Makerbot-level ABS or PLA should be good enough.  You will need 4 M3 screws, with shaft length less than 9.5mm to screw the PCB down.  If your print has sufficient resolution, it should clip in without trouble too.
